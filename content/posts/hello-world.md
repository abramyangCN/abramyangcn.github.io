# Hello World - Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm thrilled to have you here. This is the beginning of a journey where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and technical learnings.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover a wide range of topics including:

- **Web Development** - Deep dives into modern web technologies
- **Open Source** - Contributing to and building open source projects
- **Career Growth** - Lessons learned along the way
- **Personal Projects** - Showcasing things I'm building

## Why I Started This Blog

I've always believed that writing is one of the best ways to solidify your understanding of a topic. By explaining concepts to others, you discover gaps in your own knowledge and fill them in.

## Technology Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Next.js 15** - For static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS** - For styling
- **Markdown** - For content

I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing. Stay tuned for more content!
